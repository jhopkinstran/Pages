<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm Johnny, a current sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University. My academic interests span the Artificial Intelligence sphere, mainly focusing on computer vision and natural language processing. However, I am also exploring areas of reinforcement learning, especially in the context of games. Outside academics, my interests include volleyball, hiking, and robotics.</p>
